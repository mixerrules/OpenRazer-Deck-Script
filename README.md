# OpenRazer Easy Install Script for Steam Deck

This is an edited version of [Mte90](https://github.com/mte90)'s [OpenRazer Install Script](https://daniele.tech/2022/12/how-to-get-openrazer-working-easily-on-steam-deck/).

## Why use this version?

* This version fixes error in caused ny a wrong folder name in line 14 in the original script.

* Eventually this version will also have an optional step to autoinstall [RazerGenie](https://github.com/z3ntu/RazerGenie) as well.

Other that that they are the same.
